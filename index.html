        <p>Hi! I'm Beichen. I'm a pianist, photographer, and writer.</p>

        <p>On this website I'd like to share some pieces of my life and creative works, from sad times to happy times and everything in between.</p>

        <p>Want to know more about me? My favorite color is blue, my favorite kind of vacation is visiting random places and walking in nature, my favorite sport is downhill skiing, my favorite film is Forrest Gump, my favorite band overall is Coldplay, I have too many favorite songs and books. I like bubble tea, pasta, michelin restaurants, watching birds, going to art museums, meditation, occasionally playing video games and reading philosophy, spending time with friends and family. I don't like tourist traps, shopping, coriander, the mental healthcare system, poorly written documents.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Stockholm, Sweden. I've lived in China (Wuhan, Changsha, Hongkong), USA (Columbus), Norway (Trondheim), Denmark (Åarhus), Switzerland (Zurich). Having attended international school up until university has shaped me and I enjoy exploring and learning about the world we live in. I speak English, Svenska, 中文, und ein bißchen Deutsch.</p>
